## User Experience

### User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to organize my project with milestones and a Kanban board of issues, so that I can track progress and maintain a structured workflow
2. As a developer, I want to create user stories for different user roles, so that the project requirements are clear and development aligns with user needs
3. As a developer, I want to design a database schema for my project, so that the data structure supports the applicationâ€™s functionality and scalability
4. As a developer, I want to create wireframes for the application, so that the user interface is intuitive and consistent across all devices
5. As a developer, I want to create a README file with thorough documentation, so that other developers and users can understand the purpose, features, and usage of the application
6. As a developer, I want to set up a Django project so that the application has a structured foundation for development
7. As a developer, I want to create and configure a database so that user data is properly stored
