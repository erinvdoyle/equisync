  - Shows schedules can be updated in real-time by barn managers and approved staff 
4. The Community Page
  - A centralized space for announcements, events, and sales ads
  - Users enabled to post, edit, and delete content (with Admin approval for published posts)
5. Scalability and Ease of Use

#### Models

1. User  
The primary account management and authentication system. Contains login information (username, password, email) and connects to the Profile for additional details  

2. Profile  
Extends the User model to store additional personal and role-specific details such as role (owner, rider, staff), associated horses, and contact information

3. AccessPermissions  
Defines the specific permissions or roles for users (admin, read-only, edit)  

4. Events  
Represents community page events organized by users, such as barn gatherings, dinners, or parties. Includes details like date, location, and an event description  

5. Announcements  
Allows users to post updates or important notices for the community  

6. SalesAds  
Advertisements created by users to buy, sell, or trade items related to horse care and riding  

7. Horse  
A detailed profile for each horse, including attributes like name, age, breed, owner, and photo. Serves as the central model connecting to feed, exercise, appointments, and show schedules  

8. Feed  
The feeding schedule for a horse, detailing types of feed, amounts, supplements and medications, and times of feeding  

9. Appointments  
Tracks appointments for a horse, such as vet visits, farrier sessions, or other scheduled activities  

10. Exercise  
Stores the exercise schedule for a horse  

11. ShowSchedule  
Represents the show and competition schedule for a horse, including dates, event locations, and details about participation  

#### Relationships

1. User-to-AccessPermissions  
**One-to-One**: Each user has a single set of access permissions  

2. User-to-Profile  
**One-to-One**: Each user has one profile containing additional details  

3. Profile-to-Events  
**One-to-Many**: One profile can post multiple events, but an event belongs only to one profile  

4. Profile-to-Announcements  
**One-to-Many**: One profile can create multiple announcements, but an announcement belongs to only one profile  

5. Profile-to-SalesAds  
**One-to-Many**: One profile can advertize multiple sales ads, but each ad belongs to only one profile  

6. Profile-to-Horse  
**Many-to-Many**: A profile can be associated with multiple horses (a horse owner may own multiple horses) and each horse can be associated with multiple profiles (for example, owner *and* staff)  

7. Horse-to-Feed  
**One-to-One**: Each horse has a single feeding schedule. Modifications to the feeding schedule occur infrequently and archives are not stored  

8. Horse-to-Appointments  
**One-to-Many**: Each horse has one unique appointments schedule at any given time, but archives are stored so that there are many schedules on record  

9. Horse-to-Exercise  
**One-to-Many**: Each horse has one unique exercise schedule at any given time, but archives are stored so that there are many schedules on record  

10. Horse-to-ShowSchedule  
**One-to-Many**: Each horse has one unique show schedule at any given time, but archives are stored so that there are many schedules on record
